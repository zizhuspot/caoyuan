## Experience

Experience and insight can be gained over time, and not all of it is limited to a particular field of specialization. There are some general rules that are not limited to specific professions.

Once and a friend went to a famous attraction, saw a white-bearded old man sitting cross-legged on the side of the road, beard flowing, the whole person exudes the atmosphere of the immortal style of Taoism. Two people beside him said that he was a great man of virtue, a rare encounter, and could give guidance to those who were destined to be there. They even warmly greeted my friend. My friend was so excited that he felt he had made a big splash, and told me that he was definitely a great man.

I just smiled and didn't say anything, because I knew that even if I said that this person was not a master, my friend would think that I was arrogant, so I had to keep quiet. If I had the same experience as him, I would have been just as enthusiastic to visit this "man of honor".

My friend insisted on going back to visit the "master", and I was in a difficult position because it would take a lot of time. I had no choice but to tell him that I would go and say a word to the person next to me, and he would politely bid us farewell and would not greet you again, so you could visit him alone when you have the chance later. My friend was a bit skeptical. Not a moment later, he saw the man very politely bowed to us to say goodbye, waved his hand and turned to leave.

My friend asked me what I said, but I didn't tell him.

## Sweeper

We then entered a nationally recognized temple where monks often come to give lectures. The scale is magnificent, and there is an endless stream of **walking monks** from all over the world who come to listen to the lectures. The whole temple visitors, monks come and go, lively.

Walked to a corner of the courtyard, sat down to rest. Saw a tattered clothes wearing an ordinary-looking old monk in the corner, carrying a basket, stooping there to pick up waste paper.

Sitting on the steps, drinking mineral water, rest for a while. My friend laughed and said: "This old monk picking up waste paper is very serious, but also quite conscientious and responsible."

I took a close look at the old monk, looks ordinary. A worn gray clothes, wearing some fat in his body, only to see him carefully pick up the waste paper on the ground, smoothed with his hands, carefully check the content of the paper, and then put into the basket. The action is meticulous, fully concentrated, as if the surrounding noise has nothing to do with him. I felt that this old man was quite old and his ears might be a bit backward.

I suddenly had a realization and said to my friend, "This might be a senior person, perhaps the abbot of this temple." My friend thought I was joking, and laughed out loud, "If he is a senior, then I am even more senior."

We turned around in the temple, suddenly heard the Maharishi Temple drums and music, quickly crowded over to see the fun. See the monks dressed neatly, look solemn, orderly, ready to go to the temple. In front of a monk wearing a bright red robe, attracting attention. When I got closer, I saw that he was the old monk who had been picking up waste paper.

## Medicine man

I have a friend who is very successful in his career and is a very smart man. One day, he told me cheerfully that an old Taoist priest, with a famous person in tow, visited him today and told him a lot of truths and unheard-of magical stories. The old Taoist priest also gave him a prescription of Chinese medicine to cure him. He then described how the man spoke and behaved in a very unusual manner, exuding an immortal and Taoist aura. I just listen quietly, see I did not respond, he also lost heart, because he knew I know a little about Chinese medicine.

Since I have not seen this person, it is not appropriate to comment on this matter. So I told him about the life and work of a very famous local Chinese medicine practitioner.

This old Chinese medicine can be said to be a famous doctor, long years wearing a set of Zhongshan suit, looks like an ordinary old man. The most he would do is to listen to the introduction of the disease, and then "hmmmm", or ask about the disease, and then prescribe a prescription, and the mantra is: "Take it and try it." There were no other words.

He starts seeing patients in the morning, writes prescriptions, has a simple lunch of noodles, and then continues seeing patients. A prescription costs a flat ten dollars, no matter how rich or poor. Only sell the prescription not to sell drugs, take the prescription to buy drugs by your own decision to go to which cheap pharmacy. Patients are always waiting in long lines to see the doctor, and he has no time to chat. It doesn't matter if you are an official or a tycoon, a celebrity or an ordinary person, it's all the same pattern: one prescription, two words, ten dollars.

My friend was puzzled.

## Change

What seems to be the case may not be the case. Because those who are really profound don't have time to pretend to be something they're not. The ones who don't look like that may have real talent.

That said, perhaps in a few years, wearing a white washed suit, or carrying a basket to collect waste paper "high people" will be more, the times are changing. The world is a big stage, since the audience's tastes change, the market demand, the actors and actresses will also be adjusted.

Two days ago, a friend excitedly told me that he had met another master and was ready to learn from him. As I listened to him, I could see in my mind's eye his face reddening with excitement. I knew that I could not persuade him, but could only listen quietly. Over the years, I have become accustomed to hearing such stories, and I could guess what was to come.

In his "Guide to the Six Nonny", Chen Gongxian said, "I did not know at first, but I did not expect the method to be consistent with ancient events. However, in a purely Yin lesson, the Yin god of the stem, Ludu, is the day of the Lord's ambush. And the branch for the city, the upper God to overcome, and the upper God and the Yin God overcome, the main residence guards are not benevolent, and want to attack each other. And the end of the transmission of the birth of the combination of the first noble, the Lord within the secret descendants. These several things are the secret of the predecessors have not been exhausted, I do not hesitate to pen in the book, in order to teach the scholars of the future. In talking about his own insights, the tone of voice through the feelings of reluctance to disclose.

He would not have thought that the time has changed, his secret method of public rather than the most secret. If it were not for the bragging of the former, this book published today, the magic, readability and impact will not attract attention. In the current world of magic, its content is too common, so common that no one will care.

"A hang of brass and a hang of gold, take it to the street and show it to people's hearts, the brass is sold out and the gold is still there, people know it's fake but don't realize it's real." In this age of advertising and information explosion, the pursuit of content is destined to diminish.

In today's world, we are surrounded by too many colors and images, and our eyes are exhausted. How can we still have the mood to experience, how can we still settle down and slowly ponder? As the old saying goes, "the mind is restless", if the mind is restless, how can the spirit be settled?

The division of labor in society is becoming more and more refined, information is developed, services are sound, and answers are readily available everywhere. In this environment, the "eyesight" that needs to be practiced and cultivated is destined to decline.

In this age of radio telescopes, a time of collective vision loss has come.

## Pick up

Recently, the antique collection community is also enthusiastically discussing the problem of appreciation of eyesight.

In a variety of collection myths emerge endlessly. Veteran antique players, ancient porcelain expert Bai Ming, wrote a book "hit the eye record". "Eye" means that there is no appreciation of vision, bought into the fake; On the contrary, "pick up the leakage" is a very low price to buy valuable cultural relics.

Bai Ming said: "I wrote this book is to tell you: pick up the leakage does exist, only the probability is too low, more rare than airplane crashes. And hit the eye of the thing, in the antique world every minute and every second is happening."

Famous scholars, cultural relics experts, Mr. Ma Weidu also cautioned collectors: "Do not say amateurs, even professionals, and even masters, eye appreciation errors are commonplace. These years I have experienced and seen countless, there is no immortal in this field."

There is a very popular song lyrics wrote: "Lend me lend me a pair of eyes!" For those who are new or new to math, it is still necessary to remain rational and calm before opening the eyes of wisdom.
