## Origin

In June 2018, I went out with my teacher to visit ancestral homes, graves and projects.

I wanted to stay for only three or four days, but I didn't realize that some people came and stayed for eight days before they left.

Many stories happened during this period, and I will tell one of them today.  

At that time, the next day, after dealing with business, the master's late Mr. X came all the way to host a banquet. During the banquet, Mr. X came from afar to host a banquet, during which Pious said to the Master that he needed his help in one matter.

This Mr. X was young and disheveled, and then an old man to promote support, and therefore a great deal of work.

He has been nostalgic for the old kindness, and wanted to return the favor, but Mr. X's family is extraordinary, not his own. Has not been able to fulfill their wishes.

At the end of last year, Mr. Lao began to have health problems, and the hospital examination could not find the reason. The family guessed that it might be related to metaphysics, and invited many Taoist and Buddhist masters, as well as all kinds of magicians to see him, but his condition did not get better. x Mr. X heard that the master had come here, and wanted to ask the master to take a look at him, so that he could have his wish fulfilled. Out of goodwill, we went to visit him.

After arriving and having lunch, we went straight to Mr. X's house. When we entered the gate, we saw two ladies in their fifties wearing Taoist robes pointing in the courtyard, followed by two middle-aged men and women, who seemed to be members of Mr. X's family.

Mr. X went up to greet, see people are busy, we do not disturb, just stand on the other side of the courtyard.

Mr. X's house is quite large, but there is a lady whose voice is so loud that even from a distance we can still hear her words.

"Do you remember what I said? The main gate is shifted a little bit, not directly opposite, but diagonally toward X. After that, there will be a side door at the back, so that those whose family names are X and X will enter and exit from there."

After the main entrance is changed, then set up a Maitreya Buddha ......

Master and I looked at each other, both a little surprised.

These two ladies, from the dress look, should also be Taoist people, otherwise it would not be so dressed, one also holds a compass, a satchel cloth pocket, holding a book.

> "Your house, this house, mountain shape water potential ......"

I am a little confused, you said the geomancy I do not object to learning, but the door suddenly set up a four-meter-high Maitreya Buddha, the meaning of why?

Perceive my appearance, the master signaled me not to speak.

Two ladies saw us, the one with the compass glanced this way, then whispered to the old man's family muttered a few words, and then took an envelope to another, left.

Before leaving also said, other people to come are not useful, only she saw it, let her said to do, to ensure that the March will be good, leave contact information ......

I felt that her attitude and demeanor was a bit like that of a famous actor who was once a star.

Mr. X also could not help but quietly ask the master: "Master said right, really have the brake rushed body?"

> "I don't know."

Later, the old man's family to send off guests to greet, it is known that the lady is the old man's wife, the man is the old man's brother.

Perhaps because of too many people ushered in, the two were polite but not very enthusiastic, only simply entertained us into the house. After taking us to the old man's bedroom.

Into see the old man lying on the bed, the head placed a copper basin, a long hose from the next room, connected to the old man's nose for oxygen.

Mr. Lao's spirit is still good, warmly greeted us to sit down.

During the conversation, we learned that since the spring of this year, Mr. Lao has been feeling heavy in both shoulders, and then he could not lower his head, and he feels cold and hot in the back of his head and shivering when he runs for ten minutes on weekdays.

In March and April, the condition is getting worse and worse, one leg is hot and numb, at the same time, half of Mr. Lao's head began to numbness, vision loss in one eye, but the other side and the eyes have no problem.

Long-term in one side of the brain confusion, but the other side is very awake state, which tormented the old man lost more than ten pounds. What is even more bizarre is that after all the tests, MRI, vestibular test, and brain examination at the hospital, the result was not abnormal.

In the end, the old man could only rely on oxygen to maintain his spirit, except for eating, bathing and going to the toilet.

Later, some people said that he might have been hit by an evil shock. April and May so far, the old man's home to more than ten groups of people, each said each, the old man each time as little as tens of thousands, more than a hundred thousand to ask them to look at the feng shui, face, etc., to get all sorts of advice, like this today, said that the old man was a certain spirit of the monster rushed, the need to ask a certain Buddha to repair, it is said that the Buddha spent more than 100,000 yuan.

After listening to me secretly smacked my lips, did not do so dare to ask for a price, but also you ruthless ah.

Master listened to think, quietly let Mr. X go out. A few hours later he came back.

Then the master took out a vial from his bag, a reddish-brown liquid soaked in a large poisonous bee.

> He said, "You guys go out and wait for a while, we need to do some work here, so we need to be quiet."

After we went out, there were a few "ah!" We didn't know what was going on outside.

We didn't know what was going on outside.

After a few minutes, the door opened a crack and the master reached out, Mr. X took out a small packet of medicine and hurriedly handed it to him.

After another 30 minutes or so, the door opened. Mr. X, looking much better than before, came out laughing and joking with the master, thanking him and arranging for dinner.

During the dinner, Mr. Lao thanked us again and again, but no matter how much his family asked, both he and the master tacitly refused to answer.

Mr. Lao arranged for us to stay in a well-known local hotel for three days, occasionally visiting his property and ancestral home. Every afternoon, Master went to treat Mr. Lao on time.

On the fourth day, we said goodbye, Mr. Lao repeatedly refused, the master left some medicine for him. Master left some medicine for him and told him, "I can only maintain it for a while, but it may come back after a period of time. If you want to be cured completely, you still need to seek Taoist charms and medicine."

## Explain

Later, I couldn't help but ask the Master: "Did the old man really have a bad experience?"

The master said.

> "No, those people are just coaxing him for money."

I asked again: "What kind of disease is it then?"

The master said.

> "I sprained my lumbar spine playing golf, which affected my thoracic spine, causing a misalignment of the thoracic spine. This led to pressure on the cervical spine, insufficient blood supply to the brain, and damage to the trigeminal nerve."

I sighed: "Master, you let us go out at that time and said you wanted to do ......."

Master explained.

> "His cervical spine damage was too severe, compressed and protruding in extremely hidden areas. I gently for him to reset, must be skillful enough force, otherwise too much force will lead to hemiplegia. You were there, he was nervous, and so was I."

I asked again: "Master, the medicine is ......?"

Master said.

> "Mr. X found a relationship in the hospital queue prescription drugs, for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, can soothe the symptoms. But you can't take it too much, it has a lot of side effects and affects fertility. As Mr. Lao is getting old, he needs to control the dosage. Fortunately, he has an heir, so he can take it."

I asked: "Master, the wine is ......?"

Master said.

> "The prescription is indeed a true secret recipe, extremely effective, is the key. With the cervical spine reset, blood circulation."

I asked: "Master, why you and the old man out of the secretive?"

Master said.

> "Other people have been treated for a long time are ineffective, you a few times, it will inevitably attract questions. You should also be able to see that those people and the old man may have a relationship of interest, want to take advantage of the opportunity to enrich themselves. Today they want tens of thousands, tomorrow they want more than a hundred thousand, and that woman wants a million for a Maitreya Buddha, which is not a cure, but a sheep slaughter. How can you not understand the world?"

I nodded my head in realization. The master said again.

> "In the past few days, I have communicated with Mr. X and learned that he has helped his wife's family, his brother and many others. So you understand why I asked Mr. X to do the job, hoping that Mr. X would remember his kindness and follow up with a good karma for him."

I nodded again and again, and asked: "Master, when you left the words, to the old man to find someone to treat, is it really necessary?"

The master said, "Nonsense, that was just the words of the occasion. I have already cured him."

I asked: "Then why do you still say that?"

The Master said.

> "Certain rich and powerful families tend to attract greedy people. I said that in order to save the face of the people, so that Mr. Lao would not pursue them and implicate us."
>
> "I said that for the sake of the overall situation. Whether or not to go last, that is the old gentleman's decision. You need to be careful in helping others, consider the pros and cons, think twice before you act, and give a statement that everyone can accept, not only to help people out, but also to save face."

## Karma

Master looked at me and said seriously.

> "What's worse than ghosts in the world is the human heart. You're a good person, but be careful what you say. Sometimes good deeds don't pay off. I'm not stopping you from helping others, but I'm advising you to think twice about what you do, choose carefully how you do it, and do all you can to help and protect yourself." **

Later in 2022, I greeted my master and heard him say that Mr. X's project was in trouble and Mr. X helped him out.
