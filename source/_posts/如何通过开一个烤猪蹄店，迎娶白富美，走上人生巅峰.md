## Brining process

### Pre-treatment

Purchase specification: 7 inches (330 pieces of 20 catties) Fresh pig's trotters are required.

The supplier is required to cut the pig's feet in half, bring them back and soak them in water to thaw them first.

Then burn the pig's hair on the skin with a torch to remove the fishy odor. Put the burnt pig's feet into a pot and boil with water to remove the fishy smell and blood, add ginger and white wine to taste.

After boiling, use a spoon to skim off the scum on the surface of the water. Fish out the cooked pig's feet and put them into cold water to cool down. Scrub the burnt skin carefully with a clean steel wool ball and repeat the scrubbing twice to make sure no steel wool remains. Take the same steps for other pork ingredients.

### Marinade Recipe: Get rich on it!

### First marinade processing

1. blanch pork bones and chicken bones, put them into the brine bucket, add enough water to boil over high heat, then turn to low heat and simmer for more than 2 hours, until the bones are soft and rotten into crumbs. 
2. In addition to prepare a spoonful of water and half a catty of rock sugar, into the pot on high heat to boil, and then has been clockwise stirring, and so the water to dry, change the small fire slowly simmering, the process of constantly stirring, can not let the fire is too big or burnt. And so the color from white to red and then deep once, and then add a spoonful of water, to be ready to use after the sugar color simmering.
3. Once the stock is simmering, pour the prepared sugar color and all the spices into the stock, for the first time there is no need to pack the spices, so they will go directly into the pot in bulk. Then add maltose, seasoned with 250 grams of salt, 200 grams of chicken essence, 100 grams of monosodium glutamate, a catty of rock sugar, cook on a low flame for 1 hour.

Then add the original amount of spices once again, this time you can pack, small fire to cook pig's feet for 40 minutes, and then turn off the fire soak for 40 minutes, use chopsticks to poke through the pig's feet can be, if it is not yet soft soak for 10-15 minutes more.

### Note

1, if the brine flavor is not enough, you can add salt and chicken essence, the first simmering color is not dark enough is normal, do not add too much dark soy sauce or soy sauce.
2. each time you brine only need to add the right amount of salt, chicken essence, monosodium glutamate, rock sugar and spice packets, about 2 days and a half and then change once.

## How to open a brick-and-mortar store ##

### Choosing a location ###

#### Why should you choose a store near a university?

1. You don't have to be a student, but the price of your products should be within 30 RMB per person. My products are priced at about 26 yuan, and I have never done more than 30 yuan per capita in the market. If you are in the city takeaway per capita consumption of about 35 yuan, this can also be done. 2.
2. Many takeaway stores lose money because the delivery fee is eaten by the platform. If you count the delivery fee, your per capita price will be more than 30 yuan. The higher the unit price, the fewer orders, the turnover also followed the decline. Do takeaway to carefully calculate the cost, both to have a profit, but also to customers do not feel expensive. 3. 
3. Doing takeout in neighborhoods and office space requires self-delivery riders. The starting price of the rider is about 4.5 yuan. If my product delivery fee is more than 3 yuan, the profit will basically drop about 10%. 4.
4. If you are looking for a place where college students gather, it is best to have self-delivery riders who specialize in serving the campus, rather than platform riders. Their delivery fee of about 2 yuan or so is enough. This can save 3 yuan per single, 100 single will earn 300 yuan more. That's an extra $10,000 a month, which makes a big difference.

#### Store Requirements

1. Rent control in the 5,000 yuan (preferably 3,000-4,000 yuan), can be signed within 3 years of the contract, the rent increase does not exceed 15%, the deposit does not exceed 30,000 (usually 3 months to pay 3 months).
2. the store area of 15-30 square meters can be, to have a door number can apply for a business license and health permit. 3. the shop should be able to install a smoke exhaust system.
3. The store should be able to install a smoke exhaust pipe and three-phase electricity. The frontage should be wide but not deep. 4.
4. The shop should be able to do take-out business and students should be able to order food into the neighborhood. You need to ask about this, as many neighborhoods do not allow take-outs.
5. The total number of university students should be more than 30,000, but not less than 20,000 as a last resort. This is the most accurate figure I can come up with.
6. There should be more than 15 neighborhoods within a 5km radius.

#### Summary 

The lower the rent, the higher the probability of our survival, and the savings in rent will directly translate into net profit.

Plans always fail to keep up with changes, the contract deposit and lease period we try to sign a shorter, but not too short, so as not to do business, the landlord asked to move out of the headache.

**2 years is a more appropriate period. **

The store can be small, but it should be spacious enough. You need to have a display case for your products, and 250-400cm is the best size. My display case is 400 centimeters, and I can put a couple of dining tables in it.

![](https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/24/nWbdrTaBy836OXV.webp)

Must have a license plate number, many student street is a temporary building of the tin room, whether or not it is a tin room, we have to make sure that there is a license plate number, so that we can do dine-in takeaway business.

Take-out is indispensable, now the flu is frequent, many parents do not allow their children to run around, relying on student traffic is difficult to do business as before, so the key is to be able to deliver goods to the school.

The number of college students is also critical, and if there is only one university with more than 10,000 students, it will be difficult to do business. Even so, it's better to manage your own store than to work part-time.

With my model, you won't lose money. Not because it is a student street just focus on student business, the surrounding residents will also be shopping, you also need to pay attention to the number of middle-aged people on the street when you choose the location, as well as research on the surrounding neighborhoods.

Both can do ** on-campus takeout, can also be delivered to the neighborhood **, this situation is ideal.

** The investment in rent should be controlled at 18,000-3,000 **.

### Plumbing and electrical renovation

1. plumbing and flooring construction can not be sloppy, the water meter should be checked in the case of no water will be billed in error, if it will be in a timely manner to find the landlord to change the meter or resurface the pipeline. 2.
2, the power meter should be replaced with a three-phase electricity six square, do takeout power to prevent tripping. 3, the floor needs to be tiled.
3. the floor needs to be paved tiles, conducive to sanitation, the quality does not need too good, ordinary miscellaneous color tiles can be. 4. the wall can be purchased on Taobao.
4. Walls can be purchased in Taobao some wall stickers on the store looks clean and tidy. 5.
5. The best white color, the lighting effect is natural. Lighting as long as the counter merchandise area to install spotlights, so that the goods in the light more attractive. Hall and kitchen ordinary downlights can be.
6. Add up the utilities, tiles, lamps and lanterns, my 30 square meters of store cost less than 10,000 yuan. (The hood can also be installed by contractors).

### Equipment

#### Oven

The best size for a duck oven is 135*60, and the price is around 550.

<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/24/Iml4c9QJFNsXCOt.webp" style="zoom:50%;" />

#### Two microwave ovens (Grants) around 800

<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/24/slkzqHubVWn1iaB.webp" style="zoom:50%;" />

#### Other equipment

1. commercial refrigerated workbench, buy a used commercial refrigerator, the price is about 800 yuan, used as long as about 500 yuan.
2. cubic freshness cabinet also have used, the price is 500 yuan.
3. Stainless steel counter is about 2,000 RMB. 4.
4. brine bucket and stove according to the size of the price of about 1000 yuan, my are the largest. 5. signboard advertising, do not have to pay for the work. 
5. signboard advertising, do light box word about 2000 yuan, do ordinary light box is also about 1000 yuan. 6. pots and pans, adjusting the price of the food, the price of the food is also about 1000 yuan.
6. Pots and pans, spices and other materials, etc., add up to a budget of about 3,000 yuan.

#### Signboards

It is best to make two signs, one on top and one on the bottom. The top one is a light box sign, and you can design your own name, my name is "Golden Roasted Pork Trotters". You can also take a store name related to the main products, the current stage do not have to consider trademark registration, can first live the most important.

Like me, you can add a pig's head pattern. Below is a light box made according to the size of the counter, you can print the products and prices. So that pedestrians can see the information at a glance. I think the red background with yellow characters is the best, but also tried other colors but not ideal.

#### Summary

**Another $20,000 for renovations, equipment, advertising, and materials. **

**Approximately the investment for a store is another 50,000 by my standards. **

This 50,000 includes rent and rent deposit. The real investment money is in the three months of rent and pre-materials about 30,000 yuan. The rest of the money is just a deposit. If you don't want to do it, you can transfer it or return it when it's due.

### Business license and permit

To apply for a business license, you need to bring your ID card, store rental contract, and then take a photo of the door number, go to the Industrial and Commercial Bureau to fill out the information, and you can get a business license in the afternoon.

Health license can also be applied for in the Industrial and Commercial Bureau together, just ask the specific application process and prepare materials according to the requirements can be.

## How to open an online store

### Preparation

When you are almost done with the preparation of your store, you can contact the regional manager of your local takeaway platform. Neighboring merchants can provide contact information, one to contact Meituan, one to contact Hungry's, to discuss the online matters, so that they can arrange time to help you complete the operation. The operation process is not complicated, the basic 3 days can be completed.

The rest is to open the store process, is a novice task, according to the App prompts gradually complete. More cumbersome is the goods on the shelves, full reduction settings, regional division, etc., need to spend some time.

Different regions should be added to the appropriate delivery fee. However, I have a ready-made operation process here, you operate according to the steps after a slight modification can be used. If you need to private message me, I can provide a complete set of operating modules to you for free.

#### Note:

1. takeaway platform operation is completed, you can ask friends to help under a few orders of takeaway, under a single successful money back to the other side, after a few hours so that they remember to give you good reviews, preferably with pictures and text evaluation. The industry called "brush praise", 5 will be enough. Because as a new store, no traffic and evaluation, everything from scratch, your store will be the default platform sorting back, the probability of users clicking on the takeaway to see you is very low. They value mainly good reviews, sales, activity strength. But it's okay, we step by step, first of all, the pre-preparation to do enough. 2.
2. new sellers, the platform will provide a "new store privileges", is to give you 7 days of traffic exposure support, the effect is still very good. This privilege is valid for a month, we must rationalize, at least to basically hand after the use, as long as in a month, according to the actual times to enable this privilege. The general weekend takeaway single more, can be set up a day in advance in the platform, the next day will be able to take effect. To prepare the goods in advance, to ensure product quality. Chopsticks, gloves and so on can not be missing. The speed of food control in 15 minutes, try to give customers a good first experience, do not start to be bad reviews. This is still a big impact on you.
3. After the store will receive a lot of self-proclaimed takeaway operation phone, said you can help you pull single volume. These do not believe, usually cut leeks. Do not recharge on the platform to buy traffic, once recharged, the platform will default you will always be recharged, if you stop will pull down your store. Their own things to rely on their own slowly, do not understand can ask more experienced boss, they are very enthusiastic for you to answer questions, you can also ask me. You can also ask me. You should believe that the blank period will always pass.

### Profit point analysis

You should be able to see, I have been talking about is to open a snack bar project, the signature product is the characteristics of roasted pig's feet, and then with a few incidental products can be. A person can operate completely, no matter whether or not you have ever done, within a month can absolutely get started.

#### Special roasted pig's feet:

1. using more than 700g of frozen seven inches, the purchase price of 10-10.5 half, the profit is 40%. 2. pricing: 18% for half a pig's foot.
2. Pricing: 18 for half, 32 for one.

#### Five Spice Roasted Chicken:

1. one catty two taels of three yellow chicken, purchase at 10-10.5 a, profit at 50%
2. Pricing: one 20, half 12

#### Crispy Pork:

1. 320g of marinated pork, stocked at 7 a catty. If you sell 16, the profit is 120%.
2. because of the recent price of pork is relatively cheap, this profit margin can not be maintained for a long time, but also to pay attention to the

#### hoof soup:

Adopt the same seven inches, sell 18 a profit of 40%

#### Dongpo Elbow:

Pork feet circle, half open. Inlet price 9-10 a catty. Sell 18 a, profit in 50%

#### Carbonara Elbow:

Using the same ring of pig's feet, sell 15, profit at 45%.

The core competitive products are here, the rest can be appropriate brine some chicken legs and brine sausage, brine eggs, with the sale. The best seller is the roasted elbow, takeout as well. It will have more meat compared to pig's feet. There are fat and lean, love to eat very much.

### How to operate the product

I'm using a wall-mounted oven, I said before to buy a duck oven, roast pig's feet in the same way as the principle of duck. The equipment is assembled, the following burning charcoal (a box of 27 pieces of carbon can be), open the bottom of the dampers, so that the air flow of carbon burning strong. When the temperature reaches 150 degrees, put the pig's hooves on the hook and put the lid on the oven. Close the damper when the temperature reaches 250 degrees. Remove the pig's feet from the oven after 6 minutes.

Sprinkle the roasted pig's feet with barbecue powder and chili noodles and sell. Both are available on Taobao.

Five spice chicken is also roasted until the skin is golden brown, cut and sprinkled with cumin, pepper, chili powder. Also very good.

![](https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/24/UPIjgd3vb8GYDXM.webp)

#### Notes:

1. Control the heat, do not exceed 250 degrees. Lift the lid to check properly when baking.
2. During peak season, you can bake some in advance, but don't make too much. Too much time will cause the meat to turn into firewood. 3.
3. When you take out the marinated pig's feet and put them on the tray, add some marinade to soak them, otherwise put them in the display cabinet. This will prevent the meat from drying out in the wind and becoming tough, which may affect the texture.
4. do not add too much cumin and chili, the marinated pig's feet already have flavor, the focus is to achieve spice penetration.
5. Add carbon as appropriate, do not let the flame go out. If the flame goes out, you need to wait to re-light the grill, which will affect the customer experience.

Because I mainly take-away and delivery-oriented, so a variety of packing boxes and bags are necessary.

There are 3 sizes of boxes, 500ml square box for 57 RMB, 1000ml square box for 78 RMB and 1000ml round box for 90 RMB, each packing 300 boxes.

The 500ml box is used for roasted pig's trotters, roasted elbows, and half roasted chicken, while the 1000ml square box is used for 2 people at a time.

The 1000ml round box is used for pig trotters soup.

Packing bag choose 25 * 26cm transparent plastic bag can be used, takeaway orders can use this takeaway special packing bag, Taobao have sales, I think it is the most appropriate.

Chopsticks, gloves can be bought, gloves also buy individually packaged to save time.

### Takeaway platform planning and building

#### on products 

We specialize in single product snacks, not many types, but a good product system needs to reach more than 30 options.

So how do you get so many items together? First of all, you currently have all five products on-line; secondly, we can match the combination, such as pig's feet half + five spiced roast chicken half made into a small set meal, so you can change the combination. This is also a way to enhance the unit price.

My most expensive set meal is a whole roasted pig's feet + a whole roasted elbow, priced at more than 60 yuan.

![](https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/24/b6PwKMIZi7gfohc.webp)

**Set meals should also be accompanied by staple food, you can buy a rice cooker to steam some rice to sell together. There is a difference between takeout and dine-in, the purpose of ordering takeout is very clear in order to eat, while the store is not the same, roasted pig's feet as a snack, more as a snack after dinner or shopping. Generally dine-in will rarely ask for rice. This is very important**!

Can be said to be the key to business survival. "Snacks into staple food, staple food and snacks," which is one of our core business philosophy.

![](https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/24/tEMiIGTceHmrlyJ.webp)

Carefully categorized and arranged, will make customers feel you are very professional, the variety also looks very rich. Completion of this wave of operations, the basic can reach 20-30 kinds of categories.

** Another core selling point of our products is "steamed bread", it is best to find the local "Henan old steamed bread", you can directly cooperate with the breakfast store to buy, do not need to do it yourself. You can also look for the Henan people selling breakfast tricycle to buy. Old-face steamed buns with our roasted elbows is the signature combination of the store***.

![](https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/24/yDGdefNYc1zLCAQ.webp)

It is essential that you must take the time to find a source for the buns. Many students come for this set menu. The roasted elbows are a mixture of fat and lean, and are very soft. After grilling, the skin is slightly charred and sprinkled with cumin and chili noodles. How can it not smell good when served with our old-fashioned steamed buns? You can also prepare some cucumber garlic and other side dishes to relieve fatigue, the cost is not high, but immediately enhance the overall experience.

#### Primary Marketing

The platform has "full reduction activities", which should be done. The first phase of the full reduction should be divided into phases, the first phase of the full reduction, the second phase of the enhancement of the customer unit price, the third phase of the large amount of orders for preferential treatment.

![](https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/24/itpoD5aOu3LIme2.webp)

This is a basic marketing activity, but also a form of platform exposure stores, bring traffic. It can be said that takeaway pricing will be higher than the dine-in price, is a virtual price, the purpose is to give consumers a sense of preference. For example, dine-in 15 yuan of goods, in the takeaway platform how to price?

1. the first phase of the activity can be done full of 15 yuan minus 10 yuan reduction. 2. to open the Meituan membership activities.
2. to open the Meituan membership activities, the platform funded 3 yuan, merchants funded 4 yuan. 3.
3. to carry out the daily coupon activities, merchants contribute 5 yuan. 4. 
4. Distribution costs borne by the merchants, the platform draw 0.66%.

The above three is the platform must carry out traffic activities, where does the money come from?

We as merchants can not be fully funded, but also can not let consumers feel that the price is too high.

So the platform commodity to appropriate price increase: the original price of 15 yuan, the goods.

The original price of 15 yuan of goods, a reasonable price increase should be: the original price + full reduction + member activities + lunch box fee + delivery fee, that is, 15 + 15 + 4 + 1.5 + 5 + 1 = 41.5 yuan.

Roughly so, the neighborhood can be appropriate to reduce the delivery fee.

Campus area has its own rider can not charge delivery fee, other places can add 2 dollars more.

This way, consumers actually pay about the same as dine-in, we can also get the platform subsidies.

Normal can be more than about 3 yuan, so we can continue to do other self-marketing activities, such as: new customers can be set to 1 yuan; collection of stores to send 1 yuan; exempt delivery fee of 1 yuan.

This preliminary marketing activities are completed.

#### explosive marketing

Explosive is a store's signature products, such as honey snow ice city of lemonade, this affordable drinks quickly enhance the store's customer traffic. A cup of 4 yuan of lemonade popular among students, although the profits are not high, but drove the flow of people, but also drove the sales of other high-profit drinks.

Believe a sentence: as long as someone into the store to consume, you can not not make money. We can also imitate this model, whether it is dine-in or takeaway are applicable.

Careful people may find that I priced the roasted pig's feet and roasted elbows not the same standard.

Their costs will have a 1-2 dollar difference, pig's feet will be more expensive than the elbow, but I priced the elbow for 15 a, profits will be slightly reduced, but can lead to the sale of other products, takeout is the same.

At this price, two elbows is 30 yuan. We can do a large roasted elbow package in the takeaway, plus steamed buns, small dishes, drinks. Takeout can be set at 40 yuan or more, and then set a discount offer. Large roasted elbow package discount price of about 28.8 yuan, customers use coupons to pay about 22 yuan. Our actual income of about 26 yuan (this is the price for students, the community should be appropriate to add delivery costs). The price per person is clear.

The question is, a large roasted elbow sold 26 yuan still make money?

Earnings, large portion control in the dine-in two copies of the seven or eight full. The cost of such a 16-17 yuan, plus steamed buns, drinks, packing boxes, the total cost of about 20 yuan. So this pop single product I can earn 5-8 dollars. You can use this model, do a few takeaway discount packages. 

Note:

1. high-cost goods do not easily do, such as roasted pig's feet, should be based on the cost of a reasonable price, to ensure that at least 40% of the profit.
2. takeaway and dine-in prices do not let consumers feel that takeaway more affordable, many students will have time to spend in the store. To let them feel to the store consumption for us more cost-effective! Only do 1-2 kinds of discounts on takeout to attract traffic goods. 3.
3. Takeaway prices are unreasonable to adjust in time, the activities of the expiration of the timely extension. 4.
4. good comments and bad comments to respond in a timely manner. Concerned about the daily exposure data and order conversion rate, under normal circumstances, new customers and regular customers account for 50%. 



## Summary

I do catering for some years, experienced large and small stores. According to the current social pattern, it is best to invest a small amount of money, do not start to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars, the risk is too great, closed to the city for a few months will not be able to eat the rent. And the economy is not good, the consumer market share is relatively small.

R & D single product explosion is easier to survive, because whether the store rent, labor, consumables, goods are greatly reduced. Operation process is also simpler, can be quantified and refined, do not need too many professionals, people can do it well, which greatly improves the management and operation of the second store.

Do catering, big brand small brand, the core is the product, followed by marketing. To stand in the customer's point of view from time to time to examine their own, where there is not enough to do.

Choose to open a store should have the patience to run it well, business is not overnight. My store started to earn only three thousand dollars a month, insisted on doing a year before the turnaround, the highest monthly turnover of 100,000 yuan. According to 40% gross profit, I earned more than 40,000 yuan that month. I hired two employees, a base salary of 2,500 plus 20% commission, another base salary of 4,000, the remaining 20,000 are mine. This is a later story, the first must be fully run by themselves. Store to do up and then consider the development of the second.

I am also out of the countryside, 16 years old began to work, did not save any money each year, youth are sold to others, I am not convinced. Later, I set up my own stall and made money before opening my own store. I want to say, as long as you have the confidence and courage, no money, no background, but also step by step, ten years of working is also selling youth, it is better to work hard when you are young.
