## image installation

### pull mirror

```bash
sudo docker pull b3log/siyuan
```

### Create a catalog

```bash
sudo mkdir /mydata/siyuan
```

### Installation and startup

Because the data directory in the image is `/home/siyuan/Documents/SiYuan` now the structure is not the same in the two directories and can not be started, so you need to:

1. Create a temporary container, bind /mydata/siyuan 

    ```bash
    sudo docker run -d --restart=always --name siyuan \
    -v /mydata/siyuan/Documents:/www/wwwroot/siyuan/workspace -p 6806:6806  b3log/siyuan
    ```
2. Entering the container

    ```bash
    sudo docker exec -it siyuan sh
    ```
3. Copy out the data in the container`/home/siyuan/Documents/SiYuan` to  /mydata/siyuan

    ```bash
    cp -r /home/siyuan/Documents/SiYuan/ /www/wwwroot/siyuan/workspace/
    ```
4. Check if there are any problems with the replication, and if not, delete the temporary container.

    ```bash
    sudo docker ps -a # List the running containers and get the id of the temporary container.
    sudo docker stop d7ee2596218c # Stop the temporary container based on its id.
    sudo docker rm siyuan # Delete the temporary container.
    ```
5. start

    ```bash
    sudo docker run -it -d --restart=always --name siyuan\
     -v /mydata/siyuan/Documents/SiYuan:/home/siyuan/Documents/SiYuan -p 6806:6806  b3log/siyuan
    ```
6. fulfillment

## SiYuan docker upgrade

```bash
sudo docker pull b3log/siyuan ## Pull the new docker
sudo docker stop siyuan ## Stop container
sudo docker rm siyuan ## Deleting containers
## Re-generating containers
sudo docker run -it -d --restart=always --name siyuan\
 -v /mydata/siyuan/Documents/SiYuan:/home/siyuan/Documents/SiYuan -p 6806:6806  b3log/siyuan
```

## data backup

```bash
## Method 1
In SiYuan's interface => Settings => Export => Export and that's it!

## Method II
docker stop siyuan ## Stop container
cd /mydata/siyuan/Documents/SiYuan  ## Go to the SiYuan data folder
sudo tar -zcvf SiYuan.20230805.tar.gz ./SiYuan    ## Pack the data into a zip archive (requires root privileges, otherwise the zip will fail)
docker start siyuan  ## Launch Container

## Method 1 is simpler and the first method is recommended
```
