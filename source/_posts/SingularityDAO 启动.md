## What is SophiaVerse?

SophiaVerse is a Web3 Artificial Intelligence/Metaverse project that aims to bring the famous Sophia robot into human sensibility. It is the result of a long term collaboration between Hanson Robotics and the SingularityNet Foundation that will see many ecosystem projects come together to create a virtual playground with the goal of creating perceptual superintelligences.

SophiaVerse is a gamification infrastructure that builds on Sophia's development through gameplay, AI programming, and SOPH utility token usage. The goal of SophiaVerse is to create a gamified decentralized AI ecosystem where humans and AI can work together to build superintelligent systems that can lead to beneficial singularities.

To learn more, be sure to read the [SophiaVerse whitepaper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/622c1e6eb1cd192ecedc6225/6478bea1a315bfb5780f59fb_SophiaVerse% 20Whitepaper%20v2.0.pdf).

## SophiaVerse Ecosystem

- **Sophia's AI Lab (SAIL)**: interact with your own personal Sophia as she grows with you and develops a unique personality. Stay up to date with the latest blockchain and AI news. Complete tasks that teach AI programming and earn learning rewards. Utilize your newly acquired coding skills to empower Sophia and step into the metaverse together.
- **Sophia's Age of Singularity (SAOS)**: SAOS is a full-featured massively multiplayer online game where users can play with their friends and their personal Sophia companions, embarking on epic quests across time and space as they fight to save humanity and bring about a positive Singularity.
- **Sentience Wallet**: to be truly interoperable, any meta-universe experience requires a wallet that can connect to the chain where the game is hosted, as well as a wallet that securely stores the user's private data as they interact with their AI partner.The Sentience Wallet is being designed to be the go-to place for all blockchain, AI and data security needs in the go-to place.

## Key Features

- **AI-NPC Framework**: connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to in-game personalities, especially those on-chain, requires a robust and purpose-built operating system and execution framework.
- **AI-Human Hivemind**: While each user creates their own unique Sophia personality, they have the option to connect their creations to a global brain called the "AI-Human Hivemind". Bots like ChatGPT are trained to crawl the internet without understanding any of its meaning. By not only receiving training data from each user's AI, but also by playing the "human element" of the game with the AI, SophiaVerse has the ability to not only outperform OpenAI, but also create something that has motivation and moral understanding.
- **Open source AI sensibility code**: To accomplish this, all existing code is open sourced and included in Sophia's AI lab. Anyone interested can contribute their own code to assist in this endeavor.
- **AI development courses**: Only some people know how to write AI or even understand how AI works. SophiaVerse aims to address this with SAIL, including a curriculum for all ages and skill levels, so that everyone can get the tools they need to enter a new era of AI in this world.
- **Cross-Game Interoperability**: SophiaVerse was designed from the ground up to be interoperable. The ultimate goal is to introduce decentralization into the AI general intelligence race, ensuring that everyone has a voice in the implementation of general AI. Any project or community with a common goal is welcome.
- **SophiaDAO**: with the emergence of advanced intelligences comes many questions, SophiaDAO will be the guardian of the future, guiding the development and training of these AIs and educating and guiding on how best to ensure the creation of positive singularities.

## Participation Prioritization Levels

While the SingularityDAO Launchpad is open to any project worth its salt, some priority is given to AI projects and supporting the SingularityNET ecosystem. This new SDAO hierarchy will be applied to all launches on the platform, but for ecosystem projects there will also be some additional ways to participate by supporting AGIX tokens. Users holding SDAO and AGIX tokens are eligible to participate in both pools.

## SDAO Pledge Level (ERC20/BEP-20)

- S: 20,000 SDAO
- A: 10,000 SDAO
- B: 5,000 SDAO
- C: 2,500 SDAO
- D: 1,000 SDAO

## AGIX Pledge Level (ERC20/ADA)

- S: 40,000 AGIX
- A: 20,000 AGIX
- B: 10,000 AGIX
- C: 5,000 AGIX
- D: 2,000 AGIX

AGIX Pledge Portal: included ( [staking.singularitynet.io](http://staking.singularitynet.io/) )

AGIX Unbound Pools: included (pools can be found on [SDAO dApp](https://www.singularitydao.ai/vaults/unbondedvaults))

AGIX-ADA: included (requires [wallet link](http://mywallets.singularitynet.io/))

Liquidity provision: not included

Unpledged: not included

## Further engagement details

In order to participate, users need to complete the KYC/AML process, a link will be shared on social media at the time of KYC opening and hopefully participants can find the relevant details below.

Snapshots will be taken within 48 hours of the end of the KYC and at any time prior to the completion of the event to ensure that participants do not move their SDAO or AGIX.

## Safety Reminder

Never reply to any private messages, community administrators will never private message you or call you directly. Never share your seed phrases or click on unknown links. Never send tokens directly to a contract address, they cannot be recovered and will be lost, always use the appropriate dApp action to interact with the launchpad.
