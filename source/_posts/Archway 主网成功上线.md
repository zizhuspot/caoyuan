description: Announcing the launch of the main web site for the Archway protocol and describing the features and goals of the protocol, the Archway protocol aims to empower and reward the creators and maintainers of the Web3 economy (i.e. developers). For a long time, the maintainers of the blockchain ecosystem have not been efficiently and accurately remunerated, and the emergence of the Archway Protocol will change this.

The Archway protocol aims to empower the creators and maintainers of the Web3 economy: the builders. For too long, the people who keep the blockchain ecosystem alive have not been effectively or accurately compensated for their contributions across the board.

## A vibrant ecosystem

Launching alongside over 15 dapps, Archway community members will have access to a variety of wallets, the NFT marketplace, the DeFi protocol, and more. Over the next month, more than 15 dapps will be launched. Some of these include Referrals-as-a-Service, EvolvNFT, Mempools, VelocityX, Archgregator, Pipapo, BonusBlock, Vectis, Astrovault, Contract Reward Sharing Management and Architect.

Pipapo, along with NFT Marketplace and Ticketing Solutions, will use ARCH Rewards to incentivize their NFT creators.

Referrals-as-a-Service, an on-chain referral system, will use ARCH token rewards to programmatically reward referees in perpetuity, creating a self-sustaining automated referral incentive system.

## What's next?

There's a lot going on in the Archway community in the coming weeks. This includes:

- The first wave of Archway Community Proposals, which will be discussed at the Archway Community's second governance meeting. The call will take place on Wednesday, July 5th.
- The first wave of IBC connections will be implemented this week, starting with Hub, Axelar and Osmosis.
- Archway Airdrop will open applications this week, so stay tuned for specific dates ðŸ‘€.

But most importantly, Archway community members will be able to start interacting with Archway dapps, so stay tuned for a full list of launch applications coming soon.
