description: This article is the beginning of a series of quantitative trading materials, explaining the original intention of organizing these materials, because I have been in the rain, so I would like to give an umbrella to those who came after me. Willing to contribute a little bit to the later enthusiasts.

## Origin

This article is the beginning of a series on quantitative trading, so let's talk about it briefly.

When I started, I didn't know anything about it, so I started from hand-knocking the code and progressed little by little. There was no GPT at that time, and when I encountered problems I could only check Google and Baidu over and over again. Often now look back at a very simple problem, will be delayed 2-3 days of time, this time should be used to develop strategies to communicate with friends should be more improved.

I just want to simply put myself through the pit. Into the dead end into a place to summarize. So that those who really stepped into these pits, can get out as soon as possible. Don't hesitate! 

Only earn money is the king!

If this series of articles for the advancement of you to help even a little help, to find a do not understand the answer to the question. It is also the author's contribution to the Internet.

## Content

I hope to include the following sections.

1. basic introductory knowledge Although this is already a topic that has been said rotten, but in order to facilitate the weak like me, or add this piece, but not ready to go deep, ready to get a 10-minute quick start or other introductory articles to bring through, after all, these professional articles are too much, if, 10-minute introductory articles are not suitable for you, think it is too abbreviated, then The major programming sites have this aspect of the above There are also algorithmic exercises and problems. There are also algorithmic exercises and problem banks. Layout is sophisticated. User-friendly and easy to use. 2.
2. Introduction to common libraries. After all, python is a glue language. His power is largely reflected in its library above, so related libraries are ready to open a line to introduce, mainly ready to introduce pandas, numpy, web3, ccxt, ehter these, of course, the commonly used aiohttp series of asynchronous libraries will also be involved. After all, as the underlying libraries these basic support is indispensable. 3.
3. commonly used low-frequency strategies, such as the famous CTA direction of the double average strategy, Bollinger Bands strategy, and the turtle strategy, oscillator strategy in the grid strategy, the average position strategy, neutral strategy in the contract arbitrage strategy. These strategies are user-friendly and easy to implement, so you can get started quickly!
4. high frequency strategies and event strategies used by the real masters, these strategies can often be another dimension of the problem. These strategies are often used to get a different perspective on a problem, and to make steady gains in a rapidly changing market.
5. Some strange alternative strategies, such as the famous small cap strategy, can also be very profitable. This will be mentioned as a thought starter article.
6. new papers and directions in trading, which can be used to develop ideas. How to become a master? Just implement all the strategies on the market yourself. If you can take a fresh idea and turn it into a fresh strategy in a hurry, then your engineering skills are already at the level of the big boys.

## Lessons learned ##

Sometimes it's not just the broken bridge in front of us that holds us back, it's also the little gravel in our shoes. There will also be a category to share short articles and funny pictures for entertainment purposes and to provide a place to relax. As well as some life lessons, and cognitive articles, just to provide another perspective, I hope to be able to help you.

## Ending

As usual, this is the place to add a few words. Without further ado, may the future thank you for what you're trying to do now, and that's that.
